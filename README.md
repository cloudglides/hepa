# HEPA Air Purifier Project

A DIY HEPA air purifier build project combining a Philips-compatible HEPA filter with a 150mm exhaust fan in a custom 3D-printed case.

## Project Contents

### air-purifier-case.stl
3D-printable case design for housing the air purifier components. This STL file contains the structure that holds the HEPA filter and exhaust fan assembly.

### bom.csv
Bill of Materials listing all required components for the build:
- **HEPA Filter**: Philips FY0900 compatible filter for fine particle filtration
- **Exhaust Fan**: 150mm ventilation fan (HEWA brand) for air circulation

The CSV includes component descriptions, quantities, unit prices (in INR), and purchase links for sourcing parts.

## Getting Started

1. Print the `air-purifier-case.stl` file using a 3D printer
2. Source components listed in `bom.csv`
3. Assemble the filter and fan into the printed case
4. Wire and test the exhaust fan motor
